                    <h1>Problem</h1>
                    <p>The arthouse film scene in South Africa is largely underrepresented, which denies access to a
                        unique way of
                        storytelling that can be truly local without seeming ‘African’ to an outsider. Part of the
                        problem is that the
                        style is perceived such that it won’t be successful or polarise audiences. This is part of what
                        makes it special,
                        it needs a leap of faith to succeed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="four columns">
                    <h1>Brief</h1>
                    <p>To work in a group as a small production company to bring to life a story that the entire team
                        worked on from
                        inception to production level. Each team member needs to fulfil the particular role assigned to
                        them in order to
                        complete the project. The final product is to be an 8 to 15 minute short film.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="four columns">
                    <h1>Solution</h1>
                    <p>We created a film that spoke to more than just one narrative and setting, but rather that which
                        transcends the
                        ordinary. <i>Abide</i> is a narrative about beautiful suffering that is told in three distinct
                        parts,
                        each an
                        indispensable part of the greater whole. The stories deal with themes of loss and sorrow, both
                        past and present. In
                        the format of a visually and musically driven short film, Abide invites the viewer to look into
                        themselves, beyond
                        the characters and think about their own life experiences.</p>

                    <h5>A convict recollects his life prior to imprisonment. The light casting onto him reveals an exit
                        that he bolts through in an attempt to escape. Running along the beach he passes the dining
                        room table his family used to sit around. Continuing on he passes his wife and daughter,
                        looking back he notices they were never there. Driven by his desire to escape the recollection,
                        he continues on. Passing his daughter’s damaged toys, introducing the theme of the damage
                        caused by his absence from their lives. Coming back past the table missing his chair, the
                        damage now more prominent. He continues on, approaching a crowd surrounding the crime scene.
                        Pushing through, he trips over a dead body, sitting up he notices the black ink, symbolising
                        blood in a Macbeth-ian sense, cannot be rubbed off his hands. In the panic he notices that he
                        is back in the prison, ink gone, no sign that he had left.
                        <br><br>
                        A father carrying his limp daughter runs panicking to the hospital. The forest, like the beach
                        removes anything that is not important to emphasise the beauty in the suffering. The mother
                        leads the way to the hospital bed while the doctor preps for the operation. The cloth forest
                        symbolising the fragility of the girls life hanging in the hands of the doctor.
                        <br><br>
                        The war scorched earth establishes the thoughts of an old veteran photojournalist thinking of
                        his experiences. Walking through the sheets he takes the journey back to his youth. Noticing
                        something in the distance he runs to check who it might be. Looking for a pulse that he can't
                        seem to find. Rolling the body over he notices that it was a close friend. The recollection he
                        is having, projected onto him like all the photos of he took during the war.

                    <h1>Director's Note</h1>
                    <h5>This was a very personal project, that fulfilling a childhood dream of directing and editing a
                        film. Through countless twists and turns, this film ultimately represents the insight of the
                        whole team. I sought to portray a part of life that we seldom talk about and often ignore, in
                        a different light. Our core theme of beautiful suffering was derived from the work of
                        philosopher Susan Sontag, exploring how pain can be represented as beauty. Suffering is a given
                        part of thehuman condition, informing and shaping our lives as we move through it.
                        <br> <br>
                        The decision to omit dialogue from the film was decided early on, in order to focus on visual
                        storytelling. This stemmed from Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1979 film <i>Stalker</i> , which makes
                        extensive use of environment and nature to further its narrative. The contemplative and complex
                        themes also helped to further what we were trying to tell. By dividing the narrative into three
                        distinct acts, framed at each end by nature, we were able to explore the different forms that
                        suffering can inhabit. Nature will always continue to exist, even when our stories cease to.
                        <br><br>
                        This short film represents humanity; the characters are stand-ins for oneself, and portray one
                        of countless ways in which an individual might experience moments of pain and heartbreak. What
                        you as the viewer see, feel or understand from watching the film is unique to your past that
                        has shaped you as a person. There is no right or wrong way to experience this film.

                    <h1>Script</h1>
                    <h5>The writer and creative director, Skye van Der Walt and I worked closely together to write the
                        final narrative. I approached the story with a very minimalist mindset, trying to trim away any
                        unnecessary elements. We had both watched the aforementioned Tarkovsky film, <i>Stalker</i>
                        (1979), which is very much a inspiration for the minimalist approach, aside from it being my
                        general style. We worked side by side, Skye developing the narrative, and me creating the shot
                        list. This was done largely because of the original decision to remove all dialogue, making
                        this a very visually driven film. For him as a writer, it was also challenging to write the
                        script for these very reasons. <br><br><br></h5>

                        separately, in different locations. During the shooting week, we allocated a single day to each
                        location, with a day for potential reshoots. Thankfully we were able to shoot everything on the

                        We shot in three exterior locations and two interior locations, and were fortunate enough to be
                        able to shoot on two Blackmagic 2K Cinema Cameras, which effectively halved the shooting time.
                        They were supplemented by two DJI Mavic Pro drones, which gave us the extra angles we needed to
                        portray the narrative. <br><br><br></h5>

                    <h5> The exterior locations were shot on a beach, in a forest and a dried-up dam. Act 1 was shot on
                        Betty’s Bay Beach, which was a particularly difficult shoot, as the weather was not in our
                        favour. We had great difficulty with high winds blasting the section of beach that we were
                        shooting on, putting strain on both the crew and actors. The sun also came out of the cloud
                        cover as we started shooting the majority of the scenes, leading to wildly overblown footage,
                        which was saved in the edit by my co-editor Lee Colin van Wyk, and the Blackmagic’s excellent
                        RAW capabilities. This was the final day of exterior shooting. <br><br><br></h5>

                        For shooting Act 2, the second location was in the Eden Vale pine forest, which was a fantastic
                        day to shoot, and the first shoot in our shooting order. We were able to get all of the shots
                        we required, with the trees providing very even lighting throughout the day. The weather made
                        the day the easiest on the crew and cast. This location featured four actors, more than any of
                        the other locations. We did however have a series of technical difficulties, such as generators
                        running dry and a number of other logistical issues, but none that weren’t solved by Justin
                        Kingwill, our key grip. Overall this was the most comfortable shoot, and a great way to start
                        the filming process. <br><br><br>

                    <h5>
                        Act 3 was shot in the Theewaterskloof Dam, which due to the drought in the Western Cape was dry
                        in large sections. This exposed a forest of dead trees, which were the perfect backdrop for
                        this section of the film. For this shoot we used a smaller crew because parking was limited.
                        The shoot went well, getting most of our shots in the early morning, while the cloud cover kept
                        the bright sun at bay. When we lost the cloud cover, we had to improvise the final series of
                        shots to prevent severe over-exposure. The cast only consisted of two actors, both of which
                        were excellent and fantastic to work with. As the last exterior shoot, we were able to end off
                        the production on a good note, before moving to the studio shoots. <br><br><br>

                    <h5>
                        For the supplemental interior shots for Act 1, we made use of an empty classroom in the
                        Stellenbosch Academy of Design and Photography. Lee and I had already started editing on the
                        exterior footage by this stage, and the two interior shoots were each done in a half day. The
                        concrete walls provided the look we required to pull off a prison cell. The shoot used the
                        smallest crew of all shoots, and was done within a considerable time constraint. We had to get
                        creative with our lighting techniques, as we had to simulate daylight for the section where the
                        convict runs towards the ‘beach’. This shoot was fun because Lee, also serving as second
                        Director of Photography and I were able to practice a number of lighting techniques that we
                        weren’t able to in the other shoots, which used all-natural lighting. <br><br><br>

                        The final shoot, which wrapped up the production was the interior supplementals for Act 3. This
                        was shot in a photography studio, also at the Stellenbosch Academy. The shoot required the Old
                        Man to perform a number of movements to link the beginning and ends of the Act with the middle
                        section shot at the dam. My favourite section by far was the final shot of the film where the
                        Old Man sits in the chair, with the slides projected onto his face. It was an idea that Skye
                        van der Walt, the creative director and I very much wanted to execute. The concept was to show
                        the shots of him as a young man at the dam location, washing over him and building to a
                        crescendo as he is overwhelmed by his past. The shots were selected and composited by Nick
                        Hulley, our special effects artist, to create the convincing effect of projected photographic
                        slides. <br><br><br>

                        was eventually decided that we wanted to project scenes from the film, which were in the
                        editing
                        process at the time, onto the locations where the film was shot.

                        Key moments were selected from the footage, and printed onto acetate sheets. These sheets were
                        projected using an old overhead projector, and recorded on the Blackmagic. This gave the look
                        of someone changing the images by hand. This footage was graded and compiled into a file that
                        could be re-projected.
                        <br><br>
                        A skeleton crew set out at night, and using a high-resolution digital projector, we projected
                        the acetate footage onto the ground of the three loactions, combining the footage with the
                        texture of the terrain. This was then recorded with both the Blackmagic and a DSLR on a gimbal
                        for a variety of shots. The final sequence was then edited, graded and composited by the
                        creative director to produce the final product. </h4>

                                out for a Canon DSLR, and used on a tripod instead.</h6>

                                footage. The setup was extremely jury-rigged, but ultimately worked perfectly for our

                                clip. In order to get the right orientation in the projection, we had to flip the
                                laptop's dispaly orientation upside down; a challenge in UI navigation.</h6>

                                photograph of a projected image, of a projected image, of a still frame, of character
